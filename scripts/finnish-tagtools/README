finnish-tagtools

This software package provides finnish-postag, a part-of-speech and morphology
tagger for Finnish, finnish-nertag, a named entity recogniser for Finnish,
and finnish-tokenize, a tokenizer.

All tools take running text from standard input and produce tabular output
(one token per line) to standard output. See --help messages for more details.

An installer is provided in the form of a Makefile. By default, the Makefile
installs data files under /usr/local/share and executable binaries under
/usr/local/bin. To change this, edit the first lines of the Makefile.

To install, run (with appropriate permissions)

  make install

To uninstall,

  make uninstall

The software in this package is precompiled. Best efforts have been made

software yourself. This package has the following software dependencies:

- hfst-tokenize and hfst-pmatch - these are provided by
  the HFST project, https://github.com/hfst

- FinnPos - https://github.com/mpsilfve/FinnPos

All of the above are provided in this package as statically linked binaries.

All of the components of this package are licensed under licenses which are
