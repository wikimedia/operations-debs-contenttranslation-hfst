 NEWS for hfst-tools and library
=================================

This file contains all noteworthy changes in HFST development between releases.
For full listing of changes see ChangeLog.

Noteworthy changes in 3.10.0
----------------------------

* Swap directions of 'apply up' and 'apply down' in hfst-xfst, so that these commands work in the same way as in foma and xfst.

* Improvements to pmatch and optimized lookup

* Make hfst-fst2fst print a more informative error message if a gzipped native foma transducer is given as input.

* Changes and improvements in Python interface:

  * Transducer functions returning a reference to the transducer now return void.
